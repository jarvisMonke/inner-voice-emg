# Inner Voice EMG Interface

This project aims to create a fully open-source, student-built EMG-based inner voice interface. Inspired by MIT's AlterEgo but built for much cheaper, this system captures subtle muscle signals from the throat and jaw to classify silent commands using a custom PCB, ESP32 microcontroller, and ML pipeline.
